## 🧩 Key Steps  

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, normalization using `StandardScaler`.  
2. **Feature Selection** – Selecting key attributes influencing customer behavior.  
3. **Clustering** – Applying **KMeans** and evaluating clusters using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.  
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** – Using **PCA** for visualization in 2D space.  
5. **Insights** – Understanding and labeling customer segments (e.g., High-spenders, Budget-conscious, etc.).
